Truthify: Fake News Prediction
Truthify is a machine learning-based project designed to classify news articles as real or fake. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, Truthify helps identify and predict whether a news article is trustworthy or potentially misleading. The project aims to contribute to the growing need for reliable sources of information in the digital age.

Project Overview
In the era of information overload, distinguishing between fake and real news has become more challenging. Truthify aims to use machine learning to help address this issue. The project trains a model to classify news articles based on various textual features, such as:

Article content (headline, body text)
Source credibility (e.g., known fake news sources)
Writing style
Use of sensational language
The model predicts whether a given article is likely to be "real" or "fake."

Installation
To get started with Truthify, follow these steps to set up the environment and install dependencies:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Truthify.git
cd Truthify
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The dataset used in this project is a collection of labeled news articles. The data consists of:

Text: The content of the article (including headline and body).
Label: Whether the article is "real" (1) or "fake" (0).
Source: The source of the article, such as a trusted news outlet or a known fake news source.
A commonly used dataset for fake news detection is the Fake News Dataset available from Kaggle or other data repositories. You can download the dataset and place it in the data/ folder in your project.

Article Title	Article Content	Source	Label (0=Fake, 1=Real)
"Global Warming Crisis"	"Scientists warn of catastrophic global warming in 2025..."	The New York Times	1
"Alien Invasion"	"Aliens have landed in New York City, causing panic!"	Fake News Network	0
Usage
Once the project is set up and dependencies are installed, you can start using the fake news prediction model.

To train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the text, and train the model.

To predict whether a news article is fake or real:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input "The article content here"
The script will output whether the article is classified as real or fake.

To run predictions on a CSV file with news articles:

bash
Copy code
python batch_predict.py --input "news_articles.csv" --output "predictions.csv"
This will take a CSV file of articles and output the predictions to a new file.

Model Description
In Truthify, we use the following methods and algorithms to predict fake news:

Text Preprocessing
Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words.
Stop-word Removal: Removing common words like "the," "is," and "in" that don't contribute to meaningful classification.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical form using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
Machine Learning Algorithms
Logistic Regression: A baseline binary classifier to predict fake or real news.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier used for text classification tasks.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that helps improve classification accuracy.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A robust classifier for text data.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted articles.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Results
The performance of the models will be evaluated on a test dataset, with results like the following:

Logistic Regression:

Accuracy: 92%
Precision: 90%
Recall: 94%
F1-Score: 92%
Random Forest:

Accuracy: 94%
Precision: 93%
Recall: 95%
F1-Score: 94%
The Random Forest model performs the best, achieving high accuracy and reliable classification on unseen news articles.
